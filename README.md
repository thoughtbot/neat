Neat is an open source fluid grid framework built on top of [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io) with the aim of being easy enough to use out of the box and flexible enough to customize down the road.

:warning: Neat **1.6.0** requires Sass **3.3.x**. If you are using **libsass** or **sass-rails** use **1.5.1**.

Requirements
===
- Sass 3.3+
- Bourbon 3.1+

Install Instructions
===
Install/update the dependencies first:

```bash
gem install sass #or gem update sass
gem install bourbon #or gem update bourbon
```
Install Neat:

```bash
gem install neat
```
Then `cd` to your Sass directory and run:

```bash
bourbon install #If not installed
neat install
```

In your main stylesheet:

```sass
@import 'bourbon/bourbon';
@import 'neat/neat';
```

To update Neat files, run:

```bash
neat update
```

and to remove them:

```bash
neat remove
```

Ruby on Rails
===

In your Gemfile:

```bash
gem 'neat'
```

After running `bundle install` you will be able to use Bourbon and Neat together.

If you see this error `Bundler could not find compatible versions for gem "sass"` run:

```bash
bundle update sass
```

Within your `application.css.scss` file place the following:

```sass
@import 'bourbon';
@import 'neat';
```

Getting started
===

First off, if you are planning to override the default grid settings (12 columns), it is recommended to create a `_grid-settings.scss` file for that purpose. Make sure to import it right *before* importing Neat:

```scss
@import 'bourbon/bourbon'; // or 'bourbon' when in Rails
@import 'grid-settings';
@import 'neat/neat'; // or 'neat' when in Rails
```

In your newly created  `_grid-settings.scss`, import `neat-helpers` if you are planning to use `new-breakpoint()`, then define your new variables:

```scss
@import 'neat/neat-helpers'; // or 'neat-helpers' when in Rails

// Change the grid settings
$column: 90px;
$gutter: 30px;
$grid-columns: 10;
$max-width: em(1088);

// Define your breakpoints
$tablet: new-breakpoint(max-width 768px 8);
$mobile: new-breakpoint(max-width 480px 4);
```

See the [docs](http://neat.bourbon.io/docs/#variables) for a full list of settings.

Next, include the `outer-container` mixin in the topmost container (to which the `max-width` setting will be applied):

```scss
div.container {
  @include outer-container;
}
```

Then use `span-columns` on any element to specify the number of columns it should span:

```scss
div.element {
  @include span-columns(6);
}
```

If the element's parent isn't the top-most container, you need to add the number of columns of the parent element to keep the right proportions:

```scss
div.container {
  @include outer-container;

  div.parent-element {
    @include span-columns(8);

    div.element {
      @include span-columns(6 of 8);
    }
  }
}
```

To make your layout responsive, use the `media()` mixin to modify both the grid and the layout:

```scss
.my-class {
  @include media($mobile) { // As defined in _grid-settings.scss
    @include span-columns(2);
  }
}

// Compiled CSS
@media screen and (max-width: 480px) {
  .my-class {
    display: block;
    float: left;
    margin-right: 7.42297%;
    width: 46.28851%; // 2 columns of the total 4 in this media context
  }
  .my-class:last-child {
    margin-right: 0;
  }
}
```

By setting `$visual-grid` to `true`, you can display the base grid in the background (default) or as an overlay. You can even change the color and opacity of the grid-lines by overriding the default settings as detailed in the section below. Keep in mind that on Webkit, rounding errors in the fluid grid might result in the overlay being few pixels off.

The visual grid reflects the changes applied to the grid via the `new-breakpoint()` mixin, as long as the media contexts are defined *before* importing Neat.

Browser support
===
- Firefox 3.5+
- Safari 4.0+
- Chrome 4.0+
- Opera 9.5+
- IE 9+ (Visual grid is IE10 only)
- IE 8 with [selectivizr](http://selectivizr.com) (no `media()` support)

Frequently asked questions
==========================

##### How do I use `omega()` in a mobile-first workflow?

Using `omega()` with an `nth-child` pseudo selector in a mobile-first workflow
will cause the style to be applied to wider-viewport media queries as well. That
is the cascading nature of CSS.

One solution would be to provide an `omega-reset()` mixin that negates the
effect of `omega()` on that specific `nth-child` pseudo selector. While this is
often the most suggested solution, it is also a lazy hack that outputs ugly code
and can quickly get out of hand in complex layouts. As a general rule, having to
*undo* CSS styles is a sign of poor stylesheet architecture (More about
[CSS code smells](http://csswizardry.com/2012/11/code-smells-in-css/)).

The other, more elegant, solution is to use mutually exclusive media queries,
also referred to as [media-query
splitting](http://simurai.com/blog/2012/08/29/media-query-splitting/). This
would guarantee that `omega()` styles are only applied where desired.

```scss
$first-breakpoint-value: 400px;
$second-breakpoint-value: 700px;
$medium-viewport: new-breakpoint(min-width em($first-breakpoint-value) max-width
em($second-breakpoint-value));
$large-viewport: new-breakpoint(min-width em($second-breakpoint-value + 1));

.element {
  @include media($medium-viewport) {
    @include span-columns(6);
    @include omega(2n);
  }

  @include media($large-viewport) {
    @include span-columns(4);
    @include omega(3n);
  }
}
```

If, for some reason, you still think that `omega-reset` is the only way you want to go,

##### Framework X has this feature that Neat seems to be missing. Can you add it?

Unless you [open a pull request](https://github.com/thoughtbot/neat/compare/), the answer is most likely going to be no. Neat is
lightweight and simple compared to other grid frameworks, and strives to
remain so. We have plans for adding new features in future versions of the
framework, but these will be most likely to support new ways of working with
layouts on the Web, not patches to existing ones.
