**Neat** is an open source fluid grid framework built on top of [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io) with the aim of being easy enough to use out of the box and flexible enough to customize down the road.


Requirements
===
- Sass 3.2+
- Bourbon 2.1+

Install Instructions
===
Install/update the dependencies first:

```bash
gem install sass #or gem update sass
gem install bourbon #or gem update bourbon
```
Install Neat:

```bash
gem install neat
```
Then `cd` to your Sass directory and run:

```bash
bourbon install #If not installed
neat install
```

In your main stylesheet:

```sass
@import "bourbon/bourbon";
@import "neat/neat";
```

To update Neat files, run:

```bash
neat update
```

and to remove them:

```bash
neat remove
```

Ruby on Rails
===

In your Gemfile:

```bash
gem 'neat'
```

After running `bundle install` you will be able to use Bourbon and Neat together.

If you see this error `Bundler could not find compatible versions for gem "sass"` run:

```bash
bundle update sass
```

Within your `application.css.scss` file place the following:

```sass
@import "bourbon";
@import "neat";
```

Getting started
===

First off, if you are planning to override the default grid settings (12 columns), it is recommended to create a `_grid-settings.scss` file for that purpose. Make sure to import it right *before* importing Neat:

```scss
@import "bourbon/bourbon"; // or "bourbon" when in Rails
@import "grid-settings";
@import "neat/neat"; // or "neat" when in Rails
```

In your newly created  `_grid-settings.scss`, import `neat-helpers` if you are planning to use `new-breakpoint()`, then define your new variables:

```scss
@import "neat/neat-helpers"; // or "neat-helpers" when in Rails

// Change the grid settings
$column: 90px;
$gutter: 30px;
$grid-columns: 10;
$max-width: em(1088);

// Define your breakpoints
$tablet: new-breakpoint(max-width 768px 8);
$mobile: new-breakpoint(max-width 480px 4);
```

See the [docs](http://neat.bourbon.io/docs/#variables) for a full list of settings.

Next, include the `outer-container` mixin in the topmost container (to which the `max-width` setting will be applied):

```scss
div.container {
  @include outer-container;
}
```

Then use `span-columns` on any element to specify the number of columns it should span:

```scss
div.element {
  @include span-columns(6);
}
```

If the element's parent isn't the top-most container, you need to add the number of columns of the parent element to keep the right proportions:

```scss
div.container {
  @include outer-container;
  div.parent-element {
    @include span-columns(8);
    div.element {
      @include span-columns(6 of 8);
    }
  }
}
```

To make your layout responsive, use the `media()` mixin to modify both the grid and the layout:

```scss
.my-class {
  @include media($mobile) { // As defined in _grid-settings.scss
    @include span-columns(2);
  }
}

// Compiled CSS
@media screen and (max-width: 480px) {
  .my-class {
    display: block;
    float: left;
    margin-right: 7.42297%;
    width: 46.28851%; // 2 columns of the total 4 in this media context
  }
  .my-class:last-child {
    margin-right: 0;
  }
}
```

By setting `$visual-grid` to `true`, you can display the base grid in the background (default) or as an overlay. You can even change the color and opacity of the grid-lines by overriding the default settings as detailed in the section below. Keep in mind that on Webkit, rounding errors in the fluid grid might result in the overlay being few pixels off.

The visual grid reflects the changes applied to the grid via the `new-breakpoint()` mixin, as long as the media contexts are defined *before* importing Neat.

- Safari 4.0+
- Chrome 4.0+
